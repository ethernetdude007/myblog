      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;docker run :&lt;/strong&gt; The docker run command is used to create a container from an image. for example, docker run ngnix command will create an instance from the image. if the image is not present on the host, it will try to get a copy of image from docker hub if it is available there.**&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also run docker run command in detach mode by using the option &amp;ldquo;-d&amp;rdquo;. This will simply run the container in background while you can continue to perform your other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;in case, if you are developing an application &amp;amp; decide to run it as container or if you want to install something as a container that is not available on docker hub, then you would have to create your own docker image.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to create your image ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, create a file named &amp;ldquo;dockerfile&amp;rdquo; &amp;amp; write down the instructions such as where to copy the source code from, what is the entry point &amp;amp; where to install the application etc..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is the need for Docker &amp; How they are different from Virtual Machines</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Docker lets us run each component in a separate container with its own dependencies &amp;amp; libraries. This let&amp;rsquo;s us run the application irrespective of the operating system we are using.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are Containers ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Containers are isolated environments, which can have their own processes, network &amp;amp; mounts just like virtual machines except that they all share the same OS kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look at operating systems like Ubuntu, Fedora, Centos etc.. They all contain a OS Kernel &amp;amp; Software. The OS kernel is responsible for interacting with the Hardware &amp;amp; Software consists of things like drivers, user interface , etc.. So all these operating systems have the same linux Kernel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Kapil. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a network engineer for almost 13 years now, working with everything from routing and switching to data center technologies and security. Over the years, I’ve been lucky to work on a wide range of networks — some simple, some massive — and that hands-on experience has shaped not just my technical skills, but also the way I approach learning and problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if I&amp;rsquo;m honest, for a long time, I had a problem: I would read books, articles, technical documents — and while I enjoyed learning, much of it would slip away over time. I kept thinking, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;How can I actually hold onto all this knowledge?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why &amp; How I started this Blog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I always felt that there should be a place for me to post stuff which can be systematically accessed from anywhere.  I read a lot of things and  sometimes, I find them interesting &amp;amp; would like to remember them or make a note of some stuff. I used to make notes in word or some other editor, but I felt, I also need to share this information with a community which I care about. Someone might find this information useful. Initially I started a blog using content management system like WordPress which was very good, I mean, there are multiple plugins, very sophisticated indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

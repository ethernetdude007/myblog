I always felt that there should be a place for me to post stuff which can be systematically accessed from anywhere.  I read a lot of things and  sometimes, I find them interesting & would like to remember them or make a note of some stuff. I used to make notes in word or some other editor, but I felt, I also need to share this information with a community which I care about. Someone might find this information useful. Initially I started a blog using content management system like WordPress which was very good, I mean, there are multiple plugins, very sophisticated indeed. 

However, I was not posting any content for sometime. I felt opening the editor of WordPress, using the tags , etc... was too much of a hassle for me. I am not a professional content writer. I wanted something simple. more  like I take my notes when I am studying and the content should automatically get posted to the website. I don't even want people to have the ability to make comments on the site or anything. Just a simple static website. I am sure, there are tools out there that can do this for the WordPress but I figured out with some googling that something like this can exactly be done in the way I wanted using few tools/scripts. I am going to write down here how I built my blog for 2 reasons, 

1. Anyone else who would like something similar can follow along and set this up easily
2. Another reason, that I won't forget it easily once I write down. Also, I can come here anytime here & read too.

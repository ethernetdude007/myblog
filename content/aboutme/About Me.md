Hi, I'm Kapil. I've been a network engineer for almost 13 years now, working with everything from routing and switching to data center technologies and security. Over the years, I’ve been lucky to work on a wide range of networks — some simple, some massive — and that hands-on experience has shaped not just my technical skills, but also the way I approach learning and problem-solving.

But if I'm honest, for a long time, I had a problem: I would read books, articles, technical documents — and while I enjoyed learning, much of it would slip away over time. I kept thinking, _"How can I actually hold onto all this knowledge?"_

Then I came across _Building a Second Brain_ by Tiago Forte, and it completely changed the way I think about learning. Instead of relying on memory alone, I started capturing what I was learning — taking notes, organizing them, revisiting them. It felt like finally giving my brain an external hard drive. And the more I wrote down, the more connections I started seeing between ideas.

That's where this blog comes in. It’s a place where I collect my notes, write down what I’m learning, and keep track of insights — not just for myself, but for anyone else who might find them useful. I’ve kept things simple here — no comments (spam was getting out of hand), just a quiet space to share ideas, discoveries, and lessons learned.

When I'm not deep into networks or exploring new technologies, I'm busy being a dad to a wonderful little boy. Parenthood, like technology, is full of surprises — and both keep me on my toes in the best way. I’m naturally an optimist, and I believe that curiosity and learning are two of the best companions you can have on any journey.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something here that sparks an idea or helps you on your own path.

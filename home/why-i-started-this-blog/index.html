  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>I always felt that there should be a place for me to post stuff which can be systematically accessed from anywhere.  I read a lot of things and  sometimes, I find them interesting &amp; would like to remember them or make a note of some stuff. I used to make notes in word or some other editor, but I felt, I also need to share this information with a community which I care about. Someone might find this information useful. Initially I started a blog using content management system like WordPress which was very good, I mean, there are multiple plugins, very sophisticated indeed.</p>
<p>However, I was not posting any content for sometime. I felt opening the editor of WordPress, using the tags , etc&hellip; was too much of a hassle for me. I am not a professional content writer. I wanted something simple. more  like I take my notes when I am studying and the content should automatically get posted to the website. I don&rsquo;t even want people to have the ability to make comments on the site or anything. Just a simple static website. I am sure, there are tools out there that can do this for the WordPress but I figured out with some googling that something like this can exactly be done in the way I wanted using few tools/scripts. I am going to write down here how I built my blog for 2 reasons,</p>
<ol>
<li>Anyone else who would like something similar can follow along and set this up easily</li>
<li>Another reason, that I won&rsquo;t forget it easily once I write down. Also, I can come here anytime here &amp; read too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, Lets talk about how we are going to do that. here are the list of things you will need.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Obsidian</strong> : Obsidian is a note taking tool just like notepad or notepad++ but it is much better than those.</li>
<li><strong>Hugo</strong>: Hugo is a tool that kind of acts like a webserver, but it converts the text files we have into HTML.</li>
<li><strong>GIT</strong>: Then, we take our website &amp; push it to GitHub.</li>
<li><strong>Webhosting</strong> : We are going to create Webhook to push the code automatically to the hosting provider. In this case, i am using Hostinger as web hosing provider, technically, you can use any other provider.</li>
</ol>
<p>First, download <a href="https://obsidian.md/download">Obsidian</a>from here. It is available for both Windows, Mac &amp; Linux</p>
<p>In Obsidian, we will create a new folder named &ldquo;blogposts&rdquo;. You can name is anything you want, You will have to reference this folder path later. it is important to note that anything under this folder or its subfolders will get pushed to the site. Here, If there is some stuff I don&rsquo;t wish to post to the site. That goes into the other folder.
!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421151952.png" alt="Image Description">
Once you have Obsidian installed, you would need to install Hugo. but before you install Hugo, there are few pre-requisites, you need to install <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/install-git">GIT</a> (Code Repository) &amp;<a href="https://go.dev/dl/"> GO programming language</a>. Both are available on all platforms &amp; can be installed easily by following the instructions in the link. Once you install you can check in the PowerShell/Terminal the currently installed version &amp; you should see something like below.
!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421153446.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>You can now install <a href="https://gohugo.io/installation/">Hugo</a>. Just follow the instructions provided in the link &amp; you should be good. On Mac you can install it using brew, on windows, which is the current platform I am in, download the hugo.exe file, place it in your &ldquo;C&rdquo; drive &amp; update your environment variables to add the path of Hugo folder you just created.</p>
<p>!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421153948.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Once you do the above. You should be able to validate that Hugo is successfully installed by using <code>hugo version</code> in PowerShell.</p>
<p>Now, In PowerShell or Terminal, Navigate to folder where you want to store your website files &amp; give the command  <code>hugo new site &lt;sitename&gt;</code> in my case, the site name is ethernetdude. That will create a folder with the site name. let us check what&rsquo;s inside the folder.
!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421154643.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Now, let us setup GIT&rsquo;s local empty repository. these needs to entered from Hugo home directory.
This is going to tell GitHub who is making those changes to the blog.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git init
git config --global user.name &#34;Your Name&#34;
git config --global user.email &#34;your.email@example.com&#34;
</code></pre><p>Now, you have to choose a theme for Hugo. You can <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">click here</a> to visit the page &amp; choose a theme of your choice. The theme I choose for this site is <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/">Terminal</a>, because it is very simple. Different themes might have slightly different method of installing them but usually the themes include the steps to install them.</p>
<p>For Terminal, the installation I preferred was using the sub module. Just copy the below &amp; paste in PowerShell/ Terminal.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">git submodule add -f https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, we need to make sure that, the configuration file matches our theme. the configuration file I am talking about here is ==hugo.toml==. The Terminal theme has a base configuration file that you can use. copy the entire thing from the theme website  &amp; using notepad or vi editor open hugo.toml site &amp; paste it. You can add some small modifications as well according your preferences.</p>
<p>!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421171355.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Once done, you can check how the site runs locally. Now you can check the site theme using the localhost:1313 option. but it doesn&rsquo;t have any content yet.
<code>hugo server -t terminal</code></p>
<p>So, We have Obsidian, where we have our files on blogposts &amp; inside Hugo we have a folder called ethernetdude which has content &amp; inside which we have to create other folders. for the sake of my site, I am going to create folders listed below. but the default is called posts. if you don&rsquo;t want multiple folders, just make a folder called posts.</p>
<p>!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421172828.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Now, We have to find a way to sync the contents of our Obsidian folder to our Hugo folder.
In my case, I have sync <code>D:\ethernetdude\Posts\blogposts</code> to <code>C:\Users\kapil\Documents\ethernetdude\content&gt;</code>. We can use robocopy on windows or rsync on mac to achieve this.</p>
<p><strong>Windows:</strong>
<code>robocopy {source path}  {destination path} /mir</code></p>
<p><strong>MAC:</strong>
rsync -av &ndash;delete &ldquo;source path&rdquo; &ldquo;destination path&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once you successfully run your robocopy, you should can now run the Hugo server -t terminal &amp; see the blog running locally with the content. You should see that the Obsidian Markdown files are converted to HTML by Hugo.  At this point, if you are not seeing that work, you should stop &amp; troubleshoot the issue before proceeding further.</p>
<p>However, you will notice, that the images in your obsidian document are not reflecting correctly in your webpage. The reason for this is Obsidian will save your images in a different folder. So to fix this issue using the python script.</p>
<p>First, figure out the path to where Obsidian is saving those images. it can been seen in the below screenshot. In my case, I am saving the attachments in a folder called attachments under the blogpost folder.
!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421151906.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Now navigate to the Hugo Directory, under the Hugo folder, navigate to the static folder &amp; create a directory called images in it.</p>
<p>Navigate to the Hugo home folder, create a file called images.py &amp; use the below script. once done. run the code using <code>python3 images.py</code> command.</p>
<p><strong>Windows:</strong></p>

</code></pre><p>The Script should run correctly, if your directories are set correctly. You should set the posts directory, attachments directory &amp; static images folder you created in Hugo home folder correctly. Once the script runs successfully, you should see that the images from your Obsidian are getting copied to the images folder you created under static folder. Now, back to your terminal, run the Hugo server locally again &amp; see if the images are getting formatted properly.</p>
<p>So, at this point, you have obsidian, pushing the code to Hugo and the website is working fine. Now, we need to push our site to GitHub.</p>
<p>Login to GitHub &amp; click new &amp; create a new repository. You can name it whatever you want, I am just calling mine as &ldquo;myblog&rdquo;. You can choose to make your repository either public or private. I will just leave mine to public.</p>
<p>!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421183414.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Now, our GitHub is setup, Now our goal is to take all the code in our Hugo folder &amp; push that to the GitHub repository. to do that we need to authenticate, for that we will use an SSH Key. You will usually find your SSH key in the directory <code>cd ~/.ssh</code>. In my case, I already have a SSH key present. The .pub is the public key we will upload this to GitHub.</p>
<p>!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421185831.png" alt="Image Description">
If you don&rsquo;t have a SSH Key, you can generate it using the below command.</p>
<p><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;Your Email Address&quot;</code></p>
<p>Now, using the cat command, take a look at the contents of the key &amp; copy them. Navigate to GitHub &amp; go to Settings &ndash;&gt; SSH &amp; GPG keys. Now, add the key</p>
<p>Now, to make sure you can authenticate by using the command <code>ssh -t git@github.com</code>. if successful, you will get a message like this.</p>
<p>!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421191835.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Now, we need to add the remote GitHub repository &amp; this can be done using the below commands</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git remote add origin1 git@github.com:ethernetdude007/myblog.git
hugo
git add .
git commit -m &#34;my first commit&#34;
git push -u origin1 master
</code></pre><p>Now, if you go to GitHub &amp; check the repository, you will all the files in Hugo directory pushed to it.</p>
<p>!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421193523.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Now, there is one last thing, we need to do. We are going to Host our website on Hostinger &amp; Hostinger does not need all the files, it only cares about the public folder.</p>
<p>So, we are seeing all these files on the Master branch of GitHub. We are going to post the Public folder to it&rsquo;s own GitHub branch. This is called as creating a Git subtree, but for now, just know that you can use the below lines of code.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git subtree split --prefix public -b hostinger-deploy
git push origin1 hostinger-deploy:hostinger --force
git branch -D hostinger-deploy
</code></pre><p>Once this is applied, we should see a new branch appear in our GitHub repository.</p>
<p>!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421194241.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Now, GitHub is done, we need to finally push our code to Hostinger. Login to Hostinger &amp; click on add a new website. We are going to create an Empty site.</p>
<p>!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421200349.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Once an Empty site is create, go to Advanced &ndash;&gt; GIT &amp; generate an SSH key.</p>
<p>!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421201338.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Copy the generated SSH Key &amp; paste it in GitHub under settings &ndash;&gt; SSH &amp; GPG Keys and add new key just like we did in the previous step.
update hostinger the repository name &amp; the branch to the &ldquo;hostinger&rdquo; branch we created earlier. Now, we don&rsquo;t want to come here &amp; deploy the site every time we post something. we are going to do an auto deployment process. for that click on the Auto deploy option.</p>
<p>!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421204756.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Copy the webhook url from there &amp; click on the link which says setup webhook on GitHub.</p>
<p>!<img src="Pasted%20image%2020250421205029.png" alt="Image Description"></p>
<p>Paste the Webhook URL you copied on the Payload URL tab &amp; click on Add Webhook.</p>
<p>Now, what this does is GitHub, will send an update to Hostinger when ever there is a new code. However, you will need to do the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>use Robocopy or Rsync to copy our files.</li>
<li>use our Python script to copy the images.</li>
<li>use the hugo command for the site to be built</li>
<li>Then we have to do our Git commands</li>
</ol>
<p>The above, is still a lot of work. it is hard to do all these every time we add/modify some content to our blog. The below is the Script that does every single thing, we did so far. There are 2 different versions one for windows &amp; one for Mac. You need to ensure that the Variable are updated correctly as per your folders path &amp; also update the repo name.</p>

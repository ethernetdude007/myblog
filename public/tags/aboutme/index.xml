      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Kapil. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a network engineer for almost 13 years now, working with everything from routing and switching to data center technologies and security. Over the years, I’ve been lucky to work on a wide range of networks — some simple, some massive — and that hands-on experience has shaped not just my technical skills, but also the way I approach learning and problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But if I&amp;rsquo;m honest, for a long time, I had a problem: I would read books, articles, technical documents — and while I enjoyed learning, much of it would slip away over time. I kept thinking, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;How can I actually hold onto all this knowledge?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I always felt that there should be a place for me to post stuff which can be systematically accessed from anywhere.  I read a lot of things and  sometimes, I find them interesting &amp;amp; would like to remember them or make a note of some stuff. I used to make notes in word or some other editor, but I felt, I also need to share this information with a community which I care about. Someone might find this information useful. Initially I started a blog using content management system like WordPress which was very good, I mean, there are multiple plugins, very sophisticated indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
